[**Live Demo**](https://keyword-extraction-project.streamlit.app/)

## Overview

This project demonstrates an efficient and automated method for **keyword extraction** from text data using state-of-the-art techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It uses a combination of pre-trained models and custom algorithms to identify key phrases or keywords from a given text input. This can be useful in a variety of applications such as text summarization, SEO, content recommendation, and information retrieval.

## Features

- **Automated Keyword Extraction**: Extract keywords from any given text.
- **Support for Multiple Languages**: The system supports keyword extraction for multiple languages.
- **Pre-trained NLP Models**: Utilizes powerful pre-trained models for high accuracy.
- **Simple and User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface to interact with the tool.
- **Customizable**: Option to fine-tune keyword extraction settings based on user preferences.
